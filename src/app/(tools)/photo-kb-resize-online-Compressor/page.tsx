          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            Whether you are filling out online application forms, uploading documents to government portals, or submitting photos for job applications, you often encounter strict file size limits. Many websites require images to be under 100KB, 200KB, or 500KB. DocuPilot's Image Size Reducer makes this process incredibly simple and completely free.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Why Do You Need to Reduce Image Size?</h3>
          
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            Modern smartphones and cameras capture high-resolution images that can be several megabytes in size. While this is great for printing and archiving, it creates problems when you need to upload these images online. Government portals like IRCTC, Passport Seva, SSC, UPSC, and various state government websites have strict file size limitations. Similarly, job portals, college admission forms, and banking applications often require compressed images.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Understanding Image Compression</h3>
          
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
            Image compression works by reducing the amount of data stored in an image file. There are two types of compression: lossy and lossless. Lossy compression removes some image data to achieve smaller file sizes, while lossless compression reorganizes data without losing any information. DocuPilot uses intelligent lossy compression that minimizes visible quality loss while achieving your target file size.

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Tips for Best Results</h3>
          
          <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
            <li>Start with a high-quality original image for best compression results</li>
            <li>If the target size is very small, consider cropping unnecessary parts of the image first</li>
            <li>JPG format typically compresses better than PNG for photographs</li>
            <li>Use PNG only when you need transparency or for graphics with solid colors</li>
            <li>WebP format offers excellent compression but may not be accepted by all websites</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-2xl font-semibold mt-6 mb-3">Privacy and Security</h3>
          
          <p className="text-muted-foreground mb-4">
